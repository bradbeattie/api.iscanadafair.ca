# Canadian Parliamentary Data

I was trying to work with historical parliamentary data and found myself frustrated. It was scattered
across various sources in a variety of formats:


* [The House of Commons](http://www.ourcommons.ca)
* [The Library of Parliament](https://lop.parl.ca)
* [Elections Canada](http://www.elections.ca)
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Canadian_federal_general_elections)
* [LEGISinfo](http://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo)

I'm trying to tackle this problem by collecting these sources into a relational database. I figured
while I'm at it, I might as well expose the data for others via
[https://api.iscanadafair.ca](https://api.iscanadafair.ca).

* [The project's source code is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/bradbeattie/canadian-parlimentarty-data) and goes into the details of how I'm scraping all this data.
* [Download a snapshot of this database](https://github.com/bradbeattie/canadian-parliamentary-data/raw/master/deployed.sql.xz) if you're intending on making heavy use of the data.
* If there's data you'd like to see included, either [create a new issue on the project's issue tracker](https://github.com/bradbeattie/canadian-parliamentary-data/issues/new) or send me an email at [bradbeattie@gmail.com](mailto:bradbeattie@gmail.com).
